My first project on Web FrontEnd.

I learn and use HTML5, CSS and JS for this INSTAGRAM page.

View the page from Evironment on repository's right side!

You can test { 

Search box & header profile click event,

Post double click event (Liked animation -< It's currently error now. It works at my VS code but I think something wrong during upload on Github),

Swipe to go to next picture ( Swiper API )

post like & store icon click event,

}

It was great project for understand Web frontend.
Thank you.
